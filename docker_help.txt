Working with Docker Container:
AA. To initialize a container from an image run: 
				docker run -it \
					-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
					-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
					-v <path to folder on local machine>:<path to folder in container> \
					<image name> 
This script will allow for docker to use your hosts displays and it will allow you to mount a specified 
folder from your host.

A. To start a created container run:
				docker start -ai <container name> 

B. To open an existing container run:
				docker exec -it <container name> bash

C. If you want to use your host's display in the container:
	On host run:	
				xhost +local:root

D. To set the environment variables in the esim docker container run:
				source /root/sim_ws/devel/setup.bash
*Note that this can be added to your .bashrc script to run on startup






RUNNNING THE SIMULATOR:
A. Navigate to the event simulator by running:
				roscd esim_ros 
B. Run the simulator on multiple images within a folder by running:
				./run_all_textures.sh
*Within the folder you will need to specify the path to the folder that contains all of the imagery, 
as well as the folder that you want the .bag files to go into

C. To visualize the .bag output of the simulator you will need to have 3 ros terminals open. On terminal (1) run:
				roscore 
   or have the same terminal open that you used to generate the .bag files
   On (2) run: 
				roscd esim_visualization
   ON (3) navigate to the .bag file that you want to visualize and run:
				rosbag play <.bag file>
	

D. These are the topics saved in the rosbag after running the simulation:
	topics:  /cam0/camera_info         20 msgs    : sensor_msgs/CameraInfo    
             /cam0/depthmap            20 msgs    : sensor_msgs/Image         
             /cam0/events             113 msgs    : dvs_msgs/EventArray       
             /cam0/image_corrupted     56 msgs    : sensor_msgs/Image         
             /cam0/image_raw           57 msgs    : sensor_msgs/Image         
             /cam0/optic_flow          20 msgs    : esim_msgs/OpticFlow       
             /cam0/pointcloud          20 msgs    : sensor_msgs/PointCloud2   
             /cam0/pose              2413 msgs    : geometry_msgs/PoseStamped 
             /cam0/twist             2413 msgs    : geometry_msgs/TwistStamped
             /imu                    2000 msgs    : sensor_msgs/Imu           
             /tf                     2413 msgs    : tf/tfMessage
For our model, we need to save:
	image_raw
	pointcloud
	events
